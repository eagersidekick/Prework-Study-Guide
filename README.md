# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This web application can be used to track which topics were covered during prework courses, see tips about the various topics, and even choose a random topic to begin studying from. 

During the development of this application, I was able to practice HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript which culminated in the completed study guide webpage application. Furthermore, it can be used as a springboard to help select a topic of study if I am ever unsure of what topic to study next.

Further development of this study guide app would include more information in each topic section as bootcamp proceeds.
